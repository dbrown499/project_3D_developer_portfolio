# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Diamond Brown

**Versatile Software Engineer | Community-Driven Creator | Lifelong Learner**

### 💫 About Me

I'm Diamond Brown, a New York-based software engineer who brings heart, vision, and dedication to every project I touch. With a background in project management and a foundation built on community, creativity, and resilience, I approach software not just as a career, but as a calling.

I believe technology is a tool to **uplift, connect, and transform**. My journey into coding began with a desire to create meaningful change—for myself, my daughter, and my community. Every line of code I write is a step toward that mission.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

I'm currently focused on growing my full-stack development skills with an emphasis on:

- **Java, JavaScript & React** (Web & React Native for mobile)
- **Node.js & Express.js** for backend development
- **PostgreSQL** for data-driven applications
- **Automated testing** with Jest and JUnit
- **Responsive design** using SCSS & media queries

Projects like *Yumsteppers* and *Eunoia* have challenged me to think deeply about user experience, performance, and purpose. I build apps that don't just work—but **matter**.

### 🚀 Where I’m Headed

I’m working toward becoming a **senior software engineer**, with a strong focus on **backend development**, where I can build accessible, reliable, and human-centered applications. I'm especially passionate about creating clean, scalable APIs and systems that power meaningful user experiences behind the scenes.

My long-term goals include:

- 🌱 Leading or contributing to **mission-driven startups**
- 🤝 Building software that aligns with **faith, wellness, and community**
- 🛠️ Continuing to sharpen my **Java, systems thinking, and CS fundamentals**
- 🌍 Mentoring new developers and making tech more inclusive

Ultimately, I want to grow into a developer who makes a lasting impact not just with code—but with character.
